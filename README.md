# Circle-Function-1.0
This will help you to **display a circle** in **command prompt**.

# DISPLAY CIRCLE IN COMMAND PROMPT
The **circle function 1.0** is created by kvc. However, the algorithm to print the **pixels** on the right spot on the **Command Prompt** console is a **bit complex**. So, we used the algorithm they are using in C programs. Just convert the C code into the Batch format with some Batch tweaks to make it much fast and quick.

# HOW DOES CIRCLE NOTEPAD SCRIPT WORK?
The circle seems to be **Elliptical** in shape. So, Why is TheBATeam calling it a circle each time we are using it? The reason for its elliptical nature is that cmd uses **Mono-spaced** Fonts. and they are longer in height than in width. Hence, the circle (which is created using characters, not pixels) appears longer in height than the width and thus, appear as an **ellipse**. But, With some Fn.dll Plugin usage, we can adjust this property of the font and make them squared, then we can have our official circle on the console. We can use the **‘Font’** parameter of **Fn.dll** plugin and have our desired result as shown in the demo below.

Now you can see the difference in the output, from the above images. The function is very healthy in this environment and works perfectly fine. This may result in a milestone in the advancement of batch programming. And making it one step ahead towards the future.
